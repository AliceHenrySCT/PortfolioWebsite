REMINDER: Add a screenshot of the AO3 Year in Review app

To complete the portfolio integration, add a screenshot of your AO3 Year in Review app:

1. Take a screenshot of the AO3 app interface
2. Save it as: Images/AO3YearInReview.png
3. Recommended dimensions: 1200x800 or similar 3:2 aspect ratio

This will make the project card on your portfolio look complete!

You can use a screenshot from:
- The login page
- The statistics results page
- Any visually appealing part of the app

Until you add this screenshot, the image will be broken on the portfolio page.
